<h3 align="center"><b>MDS-CL's 5th Anniversary!</b></h3>

What is the MDS-CL Program? This joint venture between Linguistics and MDS combines core data science courses with advanced computational linguistics and NLP courses, equipping graduates with the skills to turn language-related data into knowledge and to build AI that can interpret human language. See what it has accomplished so far, and where it’s headed next...

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>"It's a really exciting time to be working in NLP. The field has been revolutionized multiple times in the past decade, and we are seeing great progress solving problems that were unfathomable in the past.  I'm thrilled to be working with the MDS-CL as we prepare students to process, analyse, and model data that is increasing at an unprecedented rate." <b>— Garrett Nicolai, MDS-CL Program Director</b></i></p>

<h3>Capstone Project: Cross-Lingual NER for Low-Resource Languages</h3>

<p>Capstone Projects are a mentored group project based on real data and questions from a partner within or outside the university. Students formulate questions and design and execute a suitable analysis plan. The group works collaboratively to produce a project report, presentation, and possibly other products, such as a web application. Featured <a href="https://ubc-mdscl.github.io/2021-08-13-lorem-ipsum/">here</a> is one example of a Capstone Project completed in 2021 that focuses on creating a cross-lingual NER for low-resource languages.</p>

<h3>Alumni Profiles

<h4>Meiyu Zheng, MDS Computational Linguistics, Class of 2023</h4>

<p><i>“This program stands out due to its unique blend of data science and NLP courses, serving as a quick refresher and bridges the knowledge gap for students like me who completed their bachelor's degrees years ago and are transitioning from non-STEM fields.”</i></p>

<p><b>Previous Degree:</b> Bachelor’s degree in English Language and Literature from Zhejiang University.</p>

<p>Prior to entering the MDS Computational Linguistics program, Meiyu was a curriculum designer at Duolingo where she realized the she wanted to pursue a master’s degree in data science with a focus on Natural Language Processing. When not in the MDS Computational Linguistics program, Meiyu enjoys biking and learning new languages. <a href="https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/why-data-science/student-success-stories/mds-spotlight-meet-meiyu-zheng-mds-computational">Read Meiyu's Story.</a></p>
