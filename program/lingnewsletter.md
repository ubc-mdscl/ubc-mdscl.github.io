# Program Policies and Regulations 

The Master of Data Science- Computational Linguistics Policies and Regulations are part of the campus wide [UBC Policies and Regulations document](https://vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca/?tree=3,0,0,0). Below is a summary of those Policies and Regulations that students frequently ask about and that are specific to the Master of Data Science- Computational Linguistics program. 

### Attendance 

Attendance in lectures and lab sessions is not mandatory but highly recommended. You will get the most out of the program if you show up in person. 

Instructors may set their own attendance policy on a course-by-course basis.   

**If you are feeling unwell, are experiencing any flu-like symptoms, or have reason to believe you may have Covid-19, please do not come to any in-person meetings including lectures, labs, office hours, or quizzes.** 

### Lecture recordings 

We do not require instructors to livestream or record their lectures. If you miss a class, you can catch up by reviewing lecture notes as well as by talking to peers and asking them to share their notes. When lecture recordings or livestreaming are available, instructors may grant access to students on a case-by-case basis.  

### Academic concession policy 

If you are expecting to miss an assignment, a quiz, or multiple lectures for a justified reason you can request an academic concession before the deadline. Per the UBC Senate [policy on academic concession](https://vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca/campus-wide-policies-and-regulations/academic-concession), grounds for academic concession can be illness, conflicting responsibilities, or compassionate grounds. Examples of compassionate grounds, from the above policy, include, but are not limited to “a traumatic event experienced by the student, a family member, or a close friend” 

To request an [academic concession](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/UBC-MDS.github.io/blob/master/img/Template%20-%20In-Term%20Academic%20Concessions%20Self%20Declaration.pdf?raw=1), students should immediately send a completed and signed academic concession form to the MDS-CL Program Manager via Slack. Upon receiving the form, the Program Manager, the Instructors and/or MDS Director will make a decision about how to proceed.
