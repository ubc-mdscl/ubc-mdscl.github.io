<h3 align="center"><b>MDS-CL's 5th Anniversary!</b></h3>

What is the MDS-CL Program? This joint venture between Linguistics and MDS combines core data science courses with advanced computational linguistics and NLP courses, equipping graduates with the skills to turn language-related data into knowledge and to build AI that can interpret human language. See what it has accomplished so far, and where it’s headed next...

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>"It's a really exciting time to be working in NLP. The field has been revolutionized multiple times in the past decade, and we are seeing great progress solving problems that were unfathomable in the past.  I'm thrilled to be working with the MDS-CL as we prepare students to process, analyse, and model data that is increasing at an unprecedented rate." <b>— Garrett Nicolai, MDS-CL Program Director</b></i></p>

<h3>Capstone Project: Cross-Lingual NER for Low-Resource Languages</h3>

<p>Capstone Projects are a mentored group project based on real data and questions from a partner within or outside the university. Students formulate questions and design and execute a suitable analysis plan. The group works collaboratively to produce a project report, presentation, and possibly other products, such as a web application. Featured <a href="https://ubc-mdscl.github.io/2021-08-13-lorem-ipsum/">here</a> is one example of a Capstone Project completed in 2021 that focuses on creating a cross-lingual NER for low-resource languages.</p>

<h3>Alumni Profiles

<h4 align="center"> — Michelle Yun, MDS Computational Linguistics, Class of 2023 — </h4>

<p><a><img src="/assets/img/michelle-yun.jpg" alt="Michelle Yun" class="center"></a></p>

<p><i>“I was intrigued by the MDS Computational program because it offered me the chance to step out of my comfort zone and gain new skills in coding and working with data.”</i></p>

<p><b>Previous Degree:</b> Bachelor's in Speech Science from the University of British Columbia</p>

<p>During her undergrad, Michelle took some graduate level classes in semantics and syntax where she was immediately interested in the way that language could be analyzed in a logical, mathematical way and wondered if there was a way to apply her background in theoretical linguistics to a technical field. This led Michelle to the MDS Computational Linguistics program. <a href="https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/why-data-science/student-success-stories/mds-spotlight-meet-michelle-yun-mds-computational">Read Michelle's Story.</a></p>

<h4 align="center"> — Oksana Kurylo, MDS Computational Linguistics, Class of 2022 — </h4>

<p><a><img src="/assets/img/oksana-kurylo-img-1.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Oksana Kurylo" class="center"></a></p>

<p><i>"I chose MDS Computational Linguistics as it offered a unique combination of data science and NLP courses. Also, a significant role in selecting MDS Computational Linguistics was the capstone project, where you can work on a real business problem with a company."</i></p>

<p><b>Previous Degree:</b> Masters of Applied Linguistics from Lviv Polytechnic National University</p>

<p>Before joining the MDS Computational Linguistics program, Oksana worked as a Computational Linguist and Natural Language Processing Researcher at several start-ups in her native Ukraine. It was while doing her first master's degree in Applied Linguistics from the Lviv Polytechnic National University, Oksana took a course on Computational Linguistics by Andriy Romanyuk, which opened a new world of Natural Language Processing for her. Outside of MDS Computational Linguistics, Oksana enjoys travelling. <a href="https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/why-data-science/student-success-stories/mds-spotlight-meet-oksana-kurylo-mds-computational-0">Read Oksana's Story.</a></p>

<h4 align="center"> — Toshiko Shibano, MDS Computational Linguistics, Class of 2020 — </h4>

<p><a><img src="/assets/img/toshiko-shibano.jpg.jpg" alt="Toshiko Shibano" class="center"></a></p>

<p><i>“If you are like me and enjoy devising solutions to real world problems, have a desire to transfer knowledge and skills from a previous job to the digitized world, or are passionate about language, this program is worth the money and time.”</i></p>

<p><b>Previous Degree:</b> Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from the University of British Columbia</p>

<p>Prior to the MDS Computational Linguistics program, Toshiko ran a translation business in Japan, which specialized in financial accounting and her clientele included major international audit firms, listed companies, and multinational corporations. Toshiko picked up programming to automate routine processes so that she could spend more time on translation. After handing over her business, Toshiko moved to Canada and pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology from the University of British Columbia. <a href="https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/why-data-science/student-success-stories/mds-spotlight-meet-toshiko-shibano-mds-computational">Read Toshiko's Story.</a></p>
