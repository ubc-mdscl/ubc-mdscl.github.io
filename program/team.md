## **Our Team**

**Garrett Nicolai — Program Director and Assistant Professor**

![Garrett Nicolai](https://ubc-mdscl.github.io/assets/img/garrett-nicolai-mdscl.jpg)

Garrett Nicolai is a post-doctoral fellow working on inflectional morphology in low-resource languages. He received his PhD in CS in 2017 from the University of Alberta, and is glad to be back in Canada after a brief stint in the U.S.A. He has finally been converted to deep learning, and is very interested in analyzing how similarly machines and humans learn language in general, and morphology in particular. Garrett has been teaching for MDS-CL since the first cohort in 2019.

**Jian Zhu — Assistant Professor**

![Jian Zhu](https://ubc-mdscl.github.io/assets/img/jian-zhu-mdscl.jpg)

*"I am thrilled to be teaching the MDS-CL program at a time when Natural Language Processing (NLP) is advancing at a rapid pace. With breakthroughs in deep learning, we are witnessing a revolution in the way machines understand and process human language. As an instructor, I am excited to share my knowledge and expertise with the students, and to guide them as they explore the latest NLP techniques and technologies. It is an exciting time to be at the forefront of this field, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for NLP and its applications."*

Jian Zhu received his Ph.D. degree in Linguistics and Scientific Computing from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2022. After his Ph.D., Jian had conducted NLP research both in the industry and in the academia. Before joining UBC, Jian was a post-doctoral research fellow in the School of Information at University of Michigan, working on the large-scale computational sociolinguistics. His current research interests lie in teaching machines to recognize spoken languages across the world and unstanding people's linguistic behavior in the online communities through large-scale computational methods.
