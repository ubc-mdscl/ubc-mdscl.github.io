## **Our Team**

**Garrett Nicolai — Program Director and Assistant Professor**

![Garrett Nicolai](https://ubc-mdscl.github.io/assets/img/garrett-nicolai-mdscl.jpg)

Garrett Nicolai is a post-doctoral fellow working on inflectional morphology in low-resource languages. He received his PhD in CS in 2017 from the University of Alberta, and is glad to be back in Canada after a brief stint in the U.S.A. He has finally been converted to deep learning, and is very interested in analyzing how similarly machines and humans learn language in general, and morphology in particular. Garrett has been teaching for MDS-CL since the first cohort in 2019.

**Matías Salibián-Barrera — Acting Director**

![Matías Salibián-Barrera](https://ubc-mdscl.github.io/assets/img/matias-salibian-barrera-mdscl.jpg)

Matías Salibián-Barrera joined UBC as a faculty member in 2004, and is currently a Professor in the Department of Statistics. In 2015 he received the CRM-SSC Prize in Statistics, which recognizes research accomplishments during the the first fifteen years after receiving a PhD. His research interests revolve around the problem of extracting reliable information from data sets that may not be completely trustworthy. Early on in his career he worked in the statistical software industry, and his contributions are being widely used. At UBC, he created the Statistics Department course on Statistical Learning, and participated in the creation of UBC's first undergraduate Data Science course (DSCI 100), which now attracts over 1000 students per year across all faculties.

Miikka Silfverberg joined MDS Computational Linguistics program as an Assistant Professor in 2020. Miikka has a PhD in Language Technology and an M.Sc in Mathematics from the University of Helsinki. After completing his PhD, Miikka spent one and a half years as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado at Boulder where he worked on topics related to computational modeling of word structure using deep neural networks. Miikka’s research focuses on broadening the understanding of how deep neural networks learn to represent information about language.

**Jian Zhu — Assistant Professor**

![Jian Zhu](https://ubc-mdscl.github.io/assets/img/jian-zhu-mdscl.jpg)

*"I am thrilled to be teaching the MDS-CL program at a time when Natural Language Processing (NLP) is advancing at a rapid pace. With breakthroughs in deep learning, we are witnessing a revolution in the way machines understand and process human language. As an instructor, I am excited to share my knowledge and expertise with the students, and to guide them as they explore the latest NLP techniques and technologies. It is an exciting time to be at the forefront of this field, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for NLP and its applications."*

Jian Zhu received his Ph.D. degree in Linguistics and Scientific Computing from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2022. After his Ph.D., Jian had conducted NLP research both in the industry and in the academia. Before joining UBC, Jian was a post-doctoral research fellow in the School of Information at University of Michigan, working on the large-scale computational sociolinguistics. His current research interests lie in teaching machines to recognize spoken languages across the world and unstanding people's linguistic behavior in the online communities through large-scale computational methods.

*"UBC’s MDS Computational Linguistics is the study of data science and linguistics that empower students to be future ready with tools in computational linguistics. I’m excited to work with our students and explore the new era of natural language processing."*

Jungyeul Park received his Ph.D. in Linguistics from the Université Paris Diderot (Paris VII) in 2006. His interest in natural language processing motivated him to pursue Linguistics after initially studying Computer Science. His current research interests include machine learning approaches for morphology and syntax of natural language. He is currently a lecturer in the Department of Linguistics at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada) and an affiliate assistant professor in the Department of Linguistics at University of Washington (Seattle, USA). Before that he was a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Linguistics at the State University of New York at Buffalo during 2018-2019, a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Arizona during 2016-2017, a research scientist at CEA (Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives) during 2015-2016, and a lecturer (attaché temporaire d'enseignement et de recherche) in the Department of Computer Sciences at IUT de Lannion (Université de Rennes 1) during the academic year 2013-2014.

**Carla Hudson Kam — Linguistics Department Head**

![Carla Hudson Kam](https://ubc-mdscl.github.io/assets/img/carla-hudson-kam-mdscl.png)

Carla has a PhD from the University of Rochester, and her research focuses on first and second language acquisition, developmental language production and processing, gesture and langugae learning and processing, non-linguistic constraints on language learning and language form, language contact and language change. Carla is a Google Scholar, and is the founder of the Language and Learning Lab at UBC.
