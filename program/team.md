## **Our Team**

**Giuseppe Carenini — Director**

![Giuseppe Carenini](https://ubc-mdscl.github.io/assets/img/giuseppe-carenini-mdscl.jpg)

*"One of the most unique aspects of this program is that it is designed for students whose main expertise is not in CS and Stats, but rather in other fields like life sciences, healthcare, business, and journalism; after graduation our students will be ready to effectively work as data scientist in those domains."*

Joining the University of British Columbia’s Computer Science Faculty in 2004, Giuseppe Carenini has been teaching artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing, for over 15 years. In his research, Giuseppe has focused on text summarization, information visualization, and decision support, publishing over 120 peer-reviewed publications and receiving two best-paper awards – one from the UMAP 2014 conference (premier user modeling conference ) and the other from the ACM-TiiS-14 journal (top journal on Intelligent Interfaces). Giuseppe's research has been applied by companies like Microsoft, IBM, Google, Huawei and Yahoo to develop summarization techniques for product reviews and for conversational data (e.g., emails and blog), as well as basic techniques for discourse parsing and topic modelling. Giuseppe has also collaborated with local companies that aim to make data more useful in supporting complex decisions (Compass) and for public engagement (Metroquest). Currently, he is serving as the ConVISation Labs Chief Scientific Officer, with the goal of  transferring his research on text analytics to the healthcare domain, in collaboration with the WelTel company

*"It's a really exciting time to be working in NLP.  The field has been revolutionized multiple times in the past decade, and we are seeing great progress solving problems that were unfathomable in the past.  I'm thrilled to be working with the MDS-CL as we prepare students to process, analyse, and model data that is increasing at an unprecedented rate."*

Garrett Nicolai joined the MDS Computational Linguistics program in 2020 as a post-doctoral researcher and Capstone mentor, before becoming an Assistant Professor of Teaching. Garrett completed his MSc. in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Regina before obtaining a PhD in NLP at the University of Alberta, completing a BA in Linguistics along the way. Before coming to Vancouver, Garrett was a post-doctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University's Center for Language and Speech Processing, working on low-resource computational morphology. His research interests lie in improving the quality of computational tools for under-resourced languages, including the construction of computational corpora for such purposes.

*"I am thrilled to be teaching the MDS-CL program at a time when Natural Language Processing (NLP) is advancing at a rapid pace. With breakthroughs in deep learning, we are witnessing a revolution in the way machines understand and process human language. As an instructor, I am excited to share my knowledge and expertise with the students, and to guide them as they explore the latest NLP techniques and technologies. It is an exciting time to be at the forefront of this field, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for NLP and its applications."*

Jian Zhu received his Ph.D. degree in Linguistics and Scientific Computing from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2022. After his Ph.D., Jian had conducted NLP research both in the industry and in the academia. Before joining UBC, Jian was a post-doctoral research fellow in the School of Information at University of Michigan, working on the large-scale computational sociolinguistics. His current research interests lie in teaching machines to recognize spoken languages across the world and unstanding people's linguistic behavior in the online communities through large-scale computational methods.
