---

The UBC Master of Data Science –Computational Linguistics (MDS-CL) program is a 10-month long professional master’s program. Jointly taught by faculty from Arts and Science, MDS-CL students are given access to experts in the fields of Linguistics, Statistics, and Computer Science.  

The [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) (UBC) is a comprehensive research-intensive university, consistently ranked among the 40 best universities in the world. The MDS-CL program was launched in September 2018 and is offered by a collaboration between the UBC Department of Linguistics, Department of Computer Science and Department of Statistics. The program structure includes 24 one-credit courses offered in four-week segments. Courses are lab-oriented and delivered in-person with some blended online content. 

At the end of the six segments, an eight-week, six-credit capstone project is also included, allowing students to apply their newly acquired knowledge, while working alongside other students with real-life data sets.  

### Highlights Specific to Computational Linguistics: 

* Students learn fundamental data science skills, techniques, and tools with the core Master of Data Science cohort, then branch off into more specialized courses, such as natural language processing (NLP), experiencing the benefits of a large program and small program in one 

* A small cohort model allows for individualized support from teaching team and encourages community building  

* UBC’s Vancouver campus offers students the unrivaled experience of a top 40 university, surrounded by remarkable natural beauty, at the edge of a cosmopolitan city 

* Strong connections with industry partners in public and private sectors, start-ups, and leading tech companies offer a wide range of networking/career opportunities  

Highlights Across All MDS Programs: 

10-month, full-time, accelerated program offers a short-term commitment for long-term gain 

Condensed one-credit courses allow for in-depth focus on a limited set of topics at one time 

Capstone project gives students an opportunity to apply their skills 

Real-world data sets are integrated in all courses to provide practical experience across a range of domains 

There are also general MDS options at the UBC Okanagan and UBC Vancouver campuses.
