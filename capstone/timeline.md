### Proposal revision process 

Members of an organization interested in participating as a capstone partner should submit a project proposal. 

Proposals received before November 1st will be reviewed by the MDS-CL teams and feedback/suggestions for revisions will be provided to the partner, who can then revise their proposal before submitting a proposal video to students. This revision process aims to maximize the chance of a proposal being selected by students. Proposals received after November 1st will not be provided with feedback. 

### Selection of proposals 

The MDS leadership team will select proposals based primarily on student interest, and will invite the successful organizations to be a capstone partner. 

### Partners submit video presentations 

Capstone partners should submit video presentations (approx. 5 minutes) to provide information additional to the proposals. We are not expecting production-quality videos and we do not want you to spend too much time on this. The main purpose here is to help our students better understand your project(s) before attending the capstone fair so that they are ready to ask you meaningful questions. 

### Capstone fair 

Capstone partners must attend the Capstone Fair to meet with the students and answer any questions they may have. The Capstone Fair takes place at the UBC Point Grey campus in Vancouver. For remote capstone partners, we will organize a virtual fair. Detailed information will be emailed to each capstone partner. 

### Students rate the projects 

After the capstone fair, the students assign a final rating to the projects. 

### Partners are notified of our decisions 

Based on student interest, the MDS-CL leadership team decides which projects will move forward. Student groups are assigned to the projects at the same time. 

### Partners demonstrate readiness of data and sign legal docs 

Before a project may begin, the partner must provide MDS-CL with a demonstration or written (email) declaration that the data has already been collected and prepared and exists in its entirety (in the form specified in the proposal) and is ready to be shared with the students. Partners should feel free to ask us for our standard agreement and sign the relevant legal documents before moving forward. 

### Kickoff meetings 

The students will arrange a date and time with their capstone partner, teaching fellow mentor, and career advisor to have an initial meeting to discuss the project. It is common that students sign any required legal documents at this meeting, which means the students should be sent the documents for review <b>at least 7 days in advance.</b> 

### Project 

The project itself. At the end, partners can expect the students to present at the partner organizations. Partners will also be invited to an end-of-program celebration at UBC. 

### Hackathon 

The Capstone project typically starts with a multi-day kick-off and hackathon at the UBC main Point Grey campus.
